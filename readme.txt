== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I configure the plugin? =
There is nothing to setup. Just activate it and you're good.

= Can I setup my own error message? =
No, the url to the errormessage is hardcoded into the plugin. If you want to change it, you must edit the url in the aiep.php file and upload an own site.

= I want to use the German/French/Spanish/Swedish/Italian/Russian/Portuguese version of the plugin! =
The script automatically detects from where the visitor comes and shows the page in the correct language by itself. There is nothing to configure.

= The plugin is not working. Can you help? =
Sure, just <a href="http://www.timo-ernst.net/contact/">mail</a> me your question.

= How can I help the project? =
Spread the word and try to convince other bloggers to install the plugin and help banishing the IE6 from the web.
